   This function takes two lists and returns the node they have in common, if any.
   In this example:
   1 -> 3 -> 5
               \
                7 -> 9 -> 11
               /
   2 -> 4 -> 6
   ...we would return 7.
   Note that the node itself is the unique identifier, not the value of the node.
